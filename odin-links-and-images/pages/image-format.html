        <h1>Four Main Image Formats on the Web</h1>
            <!-- I will experiment with different image formats -->
            
            <!-- JPG images are designed for handling large color pallettes without exorbitantly increasing file size -->

            <!-- GIFs are the go to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they're somewhat limited in terms of color palette-numver use them for photos -->

            <!-- PNGs are great for anything that's not photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived by the human eye) wold generally be beginner than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc -->

            <!-- SVGs are vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without the loss of quality -->
